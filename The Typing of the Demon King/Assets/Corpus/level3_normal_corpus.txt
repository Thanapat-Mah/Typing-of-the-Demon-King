No.
Okay.
I know.
Try it.
Not yet.
Tell me.
I'll pay.
I'm cold.
Nonsense.
Excellent.
Good idea.
I'm happy.
Next time.
Of course.
Thank you.
That's it.
Be careful.
He's right.
I like her.
I love you.
I'm hungry.
Never mind.
Right here.
Don't worry.
I feel good.
I'm married.
I'm thirsty.
Right there.
That's fine.
Yes, really.
I'll take it.
I'm not busy.
I'm not sure.
Let me check.
Not recently.
Nothing else.
She's pretty.
That's right.
I ate already.
Just a little.
Just a moment.
No, thank you.
See you later.
Take a chance.
Thank you sir.
That's enough.
More than that.
Thank you miss.
That's alright.
That's too bad.
I don't like it.
I don't want it.
I lost my watch.
I'm an American.
I'm not married.
See you tonight.
Take it outside.
That smells bad.
That's not fair.
That's too many.
That's too much.
