I ate already.
Just a little.
Just a moment.
No, thank you.
See you later.
Take a chance.
Thank you sir.
That's enough.
More than that.
Thank you miss.
That's alright.
That's too bad.
I don't like it.
I don't want it.
I lost my watch.
I'm an American.
I'm not married.
See you tonight.
Take it outside.
That smells bad.
That's not fair.
That's too many.
That's too much.
He's coming soon.
He's very famous.
I can't hear you.
I don't like him.
See you tomorrow.
That looks great.
That's not right.
They're the same.
You're beautiful.
You're very nice.
Everyone knows it.
From time to time.
I don't want that.
I have a headache.
I need to go home.
I'm not ready yet.
They're very busy.
This doesn't work.
Very good, thanks.
You're very smart.
Be careful driving.
He's very annoying.
I don't understand.
I'm going to leave.
Everything is ready.
I only want a snack.
Sorry to bother you.
Thank you very much.
I'll come back later.
I'm cleaning my room.
Let's go have a look.
Please write it down.
Thanks for your help.
We like it very much.
He likes it very much.
Let me think about it.
Thanks for everything.
They'll be right back.
I think it tastes good.
I think it's very good.
Let's practice English.
This is very difficult.
This is very important.
I don't speak very well.
I need to change clothes.
Your things are all here.
I'd like to go for a walk.
I'm coming to pick you up.
I'm sorry, we're sold out.
Please fill out this form.
I don't know how to use it.
I don't want to bother you.
I'll call you when I leave.
I've been here for two days.
I've never seen that before.
The book is under the table.
I'll take you to the bus stop.
